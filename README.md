          ##Disaster Predictions

Artificial intelligence and machine learning systems could help predict and respond to floods, cyber-attacks and other disasters. We can feed the computers three main categories of data.
A)--> Data about homes and other buildings, such as what materials they're made of, when they were built and how likely they are to collapse when the ground starts shaking.
B)--> Data about the natural environment. For example, "What is the soil like? What is the elevation like? What is the general humidity like? that can be effective in natural disaster prediction.
C)--> "The third thing we look at is live instant data," such as the magnitude of the quake, the traffic in the area of the quake and the weather at the time of the quake.

The computer uses the information to make predictions about what would happen if an Natural disaster occur. We can predict with help of all three category data and counter the impact for a natural disaster.
